Taxes are due for purchases from those residing in California.\r\n\r\nWe accept both PAYPAL and DIRECT CHECK OUT via Etsy. \r\n\r\nPaypal allows for payment via Paypal account, credit\/debit card or via echeck (echeck takes about a week to clear). If paying by e-check product will not be made or shipped until e-check has cleared. \r\n\r\nDirect check-out via Etsy allows for credit\/debit cards directly without any Paypal involvement. \r\n","policy_shipping":"DOMESTIC SHIPPING: We ship USPS Priority and it includes online tracking, I will send you the tracking number once shipped. \r\n\r\nIf you want to upgrade your domestic order to Express mail, PLEASE see listing in my shop marked &quot;Express Shipping&quot; or contact us BEFORE placing your order.\r\n\r\nLarge orders are shipped UPS and require a signature when delivered.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING: Shipping to all other countries will be shipped USPS First Class with no tracking number available. Once items leave the US they are no longer the shop&#39;s responsibility. Customs in your country may charge a fee and will be buyer\u2019s responsibility and will not be paid by Southern Girl Apparel. Please check on your country&#39;s customs rates before purchase.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE that for international shipments, there may be unexpected delays if your package is held at customs. We have no control over shipments after they leave our hands. Buyers are responsible for any import duties imposed by their country of residence. All orders shipped internationally through Etsy include the full purchase price on the customs form.\r\n\r\nSTOLEN AFTER DELIVERY or UNDELIVERABLE DUE TO SHIPPING ADDRESS PROVIDED ON ETSY: Refunds or replacements will *not* be issued for merchandise that has been &quot;delivered&quot; to your requested address, according to the USPS tracking number, but you claim you never received it. I am not responsible for your stolen mail, and will not provide a replacement at my expense or a refund for your missing goods. You can request a signature confirmation at delivery for an additional $2.20 USD. Also, partial refunds (minus original shipping) are issued when an order is returned to me because a delivery attempt was made and a notice was left, but the buyer did not pick up the package or arrange a re-delivery for whatever reason, or an incorrect address was provided by the buyer on Etsy. If you choose to have me re-ship the product back to you, it will be AT YOUR EXPENSE -- no exceptions. \r\n\r\n*PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE check your ADDRESS in ETSY prior to purchasing. I ship your purchase to your Etsy address. Sometimes, Etsy will try to add a &quot;Street&quot;, &quot;Terr&quot; or &quot;Drive&quot; to your address. I DO NOT alter your shipping address. Please understand there may be a shipping delay if you do not include the full address as USPS considers this an &quot;Unconfirmed&quot; shipping address. If you realize your address is incorrect after purchase, please convo me ASAP to avoid a delay in shipping and\/or not receiving your purchase* \r\n\r\nORDERS LOST IN TRANSIT: In the event that a US order is *lost in transit* by the US Postal Service and has not arrived in 45 days, as verified by the tracking information, you will be offered a refund minus the original shipping charges. I am not responsible for orders listed as &#39;delivered&#39; that are stolen after delivery (see details above). If your international order has not arrived in 45 days, it is likely lost or stolen. I am not responsible for lost or stolen international orders where I can guarantee the box was shipped by providing you with a shipping receipt on paper. Unfortunately, tracking numbers are only available for international orders where expensive priority international mail is used, which I do not offer, as it is always more expensive than the cost of my goods.\r\n","policy_refunds":"We do want you to be perfectly happy with your purchase but if for some reason you are not I do allow a one time exchange on most items, just send it back to me, be sure to include a note of what size you want. And we will accept returns within 7 days. However, the customer will be responsible for shipping costs; we will ONLY refund the purchase price. If a refund is requested on a listing with free shipping, the shipping costs will be subtracted before refund is submitted.\r\n\r\nALL ITEMS RETURNED MUST BE IN NEW, UNUSED AND UNLAUNDERED CONDITION. WE ONLY RETURN ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN PURCHASED DIRECTLY FROM ETSY\/SOUTHERNGIRLAPPAREL.COM.
