ADD RUSH OPTIONS:\nWe offer Rush Production and/or Rush Shipping options. Please be sure to see shop banner for production and cutoff times and add one or both options, depending on what you need. Rush shipping can be selected during checkout. Rush production can be added here: https://www.etsy.com/listing/172997767/production-rush-get-your-barrels-goods?ref=shop_home_active_1&ga_search_query=RUSH  Not sure what you will need, please contact us.\n\n\n\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\n ☟☟☟☟☟☟☟ ☟☟☟ PRODUCT & OFFER DESCRIPTIONS ☟☟☟☟☟☟☟☟\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\n\n✪BLANK, PERSONALIZED OR CUSTOM- WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE?\n1) BLANK BARREL: A blank, non-personalized barrel with no design.\n2) PERSONALIZED: The design shown above, with YOUR personalization.\n3) CUSTOM-YOUR DESIGN: You can order a barrel using your own design here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/BootlegBarrels?section_id=14695743&ref=shopsection_leftnav_8 See Art Req!\n4) CUSTOM-WE DESIGN: Contact us PRIOR to ordering. We are capable of creating just about any design you can imagine so just let us know what you are wanting and we’d be happy to provide a quote. Our minimum art fee is $35 for something basic or all text and goes up from there based on intricacy and time estimated to complete your artwork. Requires purchase of custom barrel, art fee and a custom listing since cost will vary based on design desired.\n\n\n✪FINISH AND HOOP OPTIONS:\n-Unfinished/Steel: Unfinished Barrel with Steel Hoops\n-Finished/Steel: Finished barrel with Steel Hoops\n-Unfinished/Black: Unfinished Barrel with Black Hoops\n-Finished/Black: Finished barrel with Black Hoops\nWHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE? Finished barrels will have a few light coats of a clear, water based finish applied to them.  Unfinished barrel will not have this finish applied.  Steel hoops are steel.  Black hoops are steel hoops coated in black.\n\n✪ RUSH PRODUCTION & RUSH SHIPPING OPTIONS: To be fair to all customers, we offer standard and rush options to all customers. Unless rush production has been ordered, all orders are produced in the order in which they are received to be fair to all customers. Upgrading shipping will expedite your shipping. Adding a rush production will place your order into the rush production queue ahead of the line. You can select one or both options based on what you need and one is not required to purchase the other. Requesting rush options in the note to seller area will not expedite your order unless you have added a rush to your order. We had to implement this policy to be fair to all customers since 85% of customers ordering have a specific date in mind that they&#39;d like their order. All current production times, order cutoff dates, etc. are all posted in the shop banner. \n\n✪ BARREL DIMENSIONS:\n1 Liter 6.5 x 4.5 x 4.5 inches\n2 Liter 7.5 x 5 x 5 inches\n3 Liter 8.5 x 5.5 x 5.5 inches\n5 Liter 9.5 x 6.5 x 6.5 inches\n10 Liter 12 x 8 x 8 inches\n20 Liter 15 x 10.5 x 10.5 inches\n*DIMESIONS ABOVE DO NOT INCLUDE STAND HEIGHT AND WIDTH. If needing to fit within a specific space, please contact us and we can provide measurements including the stand. Although it doesn&#39;t seem like there is a great difference in sizes, a 1 liter will hold an entire liter more and so on. Larger barrels also come with larger stands to ensure everything looks proportionate.\n\n✪FREE SHIPPING PROMOTION:\nFree Standard Domestic Shipping within the Continental USA only. Excludes orders shipping to AK, HI, PR or internationally, as shipping is higher to ship to these locations. Excludes all expedited options. We reserve the right to ship the most economical way, (most often USPS 1st class) and therefore cannot guarantee a specific delivery date with free shipping offer. If ordering multiple items, we may split your order into multiple shipments to reduce shipping costs. \n\n✪ ENGRAVING INFO:\nEach design will state what lines can be personalized free. Copy and paste personalization lines and enter your personalization in note to seller area. If you selected personalized and did not enter personalization- no worries, you will be contacted to get the needed info prior to shipping your order :) If you ordered a blank barrel, but entered personalization, your barrel will arrive blank-you will only get a personalized barrel if you ordered a personalized barrel. Please be sure to enter all personalization exactly as you want it engraved. Note that some fonts used in certain designs do not always have both upper and lower case characters. In this case all letters will be uppercase regardless of how it is entered since this is all the font allows. Please refer to the images in each listing for reference. \n\n✪ INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:\nWe ship to most destinations worldwide! Please be aware that if we are unable to ship to your location, we will notify you, cancel your order and refund you in full. Shipping calculation errors may occur with international shipping on Etsy that are out of our control and we accept no responsibility for these errors. If ordering multiple items, we reserve the right to ship in multiple packages to reduce shipping costs. With the lowest cost shipping selected, we reserve the right to ship the most economical way, (usually USPS 1st class) and other carriers may be used regardless of what carrier method is stated during checkout. In the event shipping is much higher than shown we will contact you and offer to invoice for the difference or cancel your order. If you decide to cancel, we will issue you a full refund. We want to continue to offer international shipping, so thank you for your understanding.\n\nPlease be sure we have all information needed to create your one of a kind barrel. If we do not receive all necessary information to create your custom barrel, your order will be placed on hold so we can contact you. Please be sure to include all info~ we really want you to love your custom barrel!  \n\n☎ Have Questions or need help creating your customized barrel?  There&#39;s a lot of options, so please feel free to contact us and we will be happy to assist you.\n\nThank you for your business!  We appreciate each and every one of you :)\n\nCSB_200",

Each listing clearly states what customization can be made (if any). By customer request, the option to order blank barrels are now on every listing so it is easier to find. To order a completely blank barrel, simply select &quot;blank barrel&quot;. Since most personalized designs are just templates and will be engraved as shown, but with your personalization copied/pasted into the template, we do not provide proofs on these designs. We only include proofs on full custom artwork orders (additional cost). This helps to keep turnaround times as quick as possible.\r\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\r\n\r\nCHANGES & CANCELLATIONS:\r\nOnce an order is received, a shipping label is created and your order is pre-labeled and entered into the production queue. Since it can be rather difficult to track down an order already in production, we ask that you please double check all information you are submitting for accuracy prior to submitting, (including personalization, shipping address, sizing, etc.). Our listings are very detailed, so generally provide quite a bit of info within the listing as well in regards to what is needed. This helps to eliminate confusion and mistakes from being made. Due to these reasons and due to many changes being requested, especially around holidays, we had to implement a no change- no cancellation policy and cannot make exceptions. If you need to make a change to the shipping address or personalization please contact us IMMEDIATELY. We can in no way guarantee the change will be made, but will make every effort to change your order for you.  Once a label has been purhcased and printed, we will not make changes to the shipping address.  In the event a cancellation is honored, there will be a $35 cancellation fee assessed. By requesting cancellation, you are agreeing to this charge. You can view our cancellation and change request policy on our policy page for more info.\r\n\r\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\r\n\r\n✪SUBSTITUTIONS:\r\nPlease note that in very rare circumstances (usually around Christmas), we may, at our discretion, substitute for a different hoop color if the wait time for the color you ordered exceeds one week.  This is very rare, but can happen and is something that every barrel company has to deal with from time to time and therefore, this will not warrant a refund or replacement as this cannot be helped. \r\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\r\n\r\n☎ Please feel free to contact us and we will be happy to assist you.

Unless rush production has been ordered, all orders are produced in the order in which they are received to be fair to all customers. Upgrading shipping will expedite your shipping. Adding a rush production will place your order into the rush production queue ahead of the standard production line. You can select one or both options based on what you need and one is not required to purchase the other. Requesting rush options in the note to seller area will not expedite your order unless you have added that rush upgrade. We had to implement this policy to be fair to all customers since 85% of customers ordering have a specific date in mind that they&#39;d like their order. All current production times, order cutoff dates, etc. are all posted in the shop banner. Customers are responsible for contacting us prior to placing order when needing by a close date and we cannot be responsible for late deliveries when the appropriate rush options are not added. Thank you for your understanding. \n\n★NOTE: All transit time provided by USPS as estimates and not guaranteed date of arrival. Although we can provide eta&#39;s, we are not the carrier so we cannot personally guarantee delivery dates. Insurance is available at additional cost when requested and paid prior to placing your order. We are not liable for incorrectly entered information entered by the customer that cause missing, late, returned or undelivered packages. We are responsible for the item prior to shipping, but the carrier is ultimately responsible for delivery once in possession of the package. We cannot be responsible for carrier delays due to inclement weather, customs or carrier delays or any issues out of our control. No refunds will be given (even for rush services), when these issues arise as we cannot prevent them, nor control them. Please contact the carrier directly for any shipping related issues- a tracking number is provided on all orders for your convenience. We are happy to assist and direct you the best we can should any shipping issue arise, but we are not the carrier so have no control over the outcome.

Please be aware that if we are unable to ship to your location, we will notify you, cancel your order and refund you in full. Shipping calculation errors may occur with international shipping on Etsy that are out of our control and we accept no responsibility for these errors. If ordering multiple items, we reserve the right to ship in separate or multiple packages to reduce shipping costs. We reserve the right to use other carriers other than USPS if it is more cost effective and the lowest shipping shown is always for the most economical shipping option available regardless of what method is stated during checkout. In the event shipping is much higher than shown we will contact you and offer to invoice for the difference or cancel your order. If you decide to cancel, we will issue you a full refund.

Questions can still be answered on weekends and after hours when we are available.  If nobody is available, your question will be answered on the next business day. Although we may be able to answer questions and phone calls on occasion during these times, our stores are not open and we are not in production on the following dates (unless notated):\n\nNew Years: Dec 31st- January 1st\nValentine&#39;s Day: closed weekend as usual\nEaster weekend: March 25th-28th (Good Friday- Easter Monday)\nMother&#39;s Day: closed over weekend as usual\nFather&#39;s Day: closed over weekend as usual\nIndependence Day: July 1rst-5th\nLabor Day: Sept. 5th\nHalloween: Open until noon\nThanksgiving: November 22th-25th & weekend, reopen 11/28 as usual.\nChristmas: Closed 12/22-12/27 for Christmas Break.  We will re-open 12/28 as usual. \n\nEtsy is a multi cultural site, so it does not always observe Holidays as we do.  For certain Holidays, Etsy does not seem to automatically account for Holiday closings and may cause a miscalculation in your shipping time frame around these Holidays.

"policy_refunds": "✌ EXCHANGES: We gladly accept exchanges when we make an error on your order. REQUESTING AN EXCHANGE:\n ✔Contact us within 5 days of delivery\n✔ Send us a good quality photo clearly detailing the issue\n✔ We will review your exchange request and get back to you and if warranted, we will\n✔ Provide you with a free RMA label for return of the defective package.\n✔ You must ship the item back to us within 2 days of RMA provided.\nNOTE: We are not responsible for errors entered incorrectly by customer, including but not limited to personalization, punctuation, shipping info. Since we provide free exchanges and we pay for return shipping, all exchanges will require return of defective product prior to exchange item being shipped. All replacement&#39;s are for the same exact item only, with the same exact design, personalization, finish, etc. and no changes can be made to your initial order. If the item is not returned in its original condition, the buyer is responsible for any loss in value. \n\n☠ RETURNS & REFUNDS: \nBlank items may be returned for up to 30 days- customer is responsible for a 25% restocking fee, as well as all associated shipping charges (original shipping charge and return shipping) on blank items, even if it shipped free. We do not offer refunds or accept returns on personalized or custom items since once an item is personalized it cannot simply be returned to stock. \n\n⚛ NATURAL VARIATIONS: We like to be as up front and honest as possible, so here are different variations that are common in barrels regardless of where you order from. Barrels are made of wood and wood is a natural product, so each item will vary in color and grain pattern and may be lighter or darker than depicted in photos. Barrels are engraved using a commercial laser and not printed. Divots will be present from the manufacturing process (not the engraving process) and will be present on every barrel regardless of where you order and some will be more prominent than others. Since barrels will expand when cured, it is not uncommon for rings to fall off during shipping- simply slip rings back on and cure as usual. These things are not something that can be controlled for any wood product (not just barrels) and therefor will not warrant an exchange or refund. This is what makes each barrel unique. Just enjoy your unique one of a kind barrel for the unique work of art it truly is and it&#39;ll love you back ;)  \n\n☠ ORDER CHANGES & CANCELLATIONS: Please contact us immediately (within 24 hours) if changes need to be made to your order. Although we have a no change/no cancellation policy we will do our best to accommodate, but in no way can we guarantee a change can be made. Fees: A 25% fee applies to all cancelled orders and/or any change requests involving reprinting of label when not yet in production. Once in production, no changes or cancellation requests will be honored, as it can take time to locate, pull and update an order. \n\n💰 SALE PRICING/PROMOTIONAL PERIODS: Pricing is subject to change without notice. We on occasion offer sales, free shipping offers, coupon codes and freebies. As with any website, a sale can be here today and gone tomorrow. If you place an order today and a sale starts tomorrow, this does not constitute a refund, just as if you were placing an order today and the price went up tomorrow we would not expect the difference.\n\n☠ ABANDONED ORDERS: We cannot process an order that is incomplete, not correctly entered or where additional shipping or fees may be due. If this arises, we will place your order on hold and attempt to contact you via Etsy messaging 3 times. We will hold your order for a period of 60 days in which your order will then be considered abandoned, after which time you may receive an automated blank shipping notification. This does not mean the item has shipped, it is simply the systems way of removing the order from queue. No refunds will be given and no cancellation requests accepted after 60 days from date of your order.",
"policy_additional": "►DESIGN PROOFS: \nWe get asked for design proofs A LOT.  So much in fact that we had to come up with ways to reduce the need for proofing in order to keep turnaround times to a minimum. This is where templates come in. Template designs (shown in our shop) is a design option that utilizes a template for part or all of it&#39;s design, while allowing specific areas to be personalized. Creating and offering template designs eliminates the need for proofing since the layout, fonts (design) shown, but with your personalization copied/pasted into the template prior to engraving. Proofing is also not included in logo barrel orders since you are essentially submitting your own proof when you submit the image to be engraved. Only full custom designs or orders in which you are charged an art fee for creating or editing and large corporate logo orders can request a design proof.  Proofing may be subject to a $25 proof charge so please request a custom listing if you would like to add a design proof- Do not make proof requests in the note to seller area.  We include the initial proof, one small revision, as well as one additional proof in each paid art fee or proof fee.  Proofs are not photographs of the actual barrel or mockups- they are just proofs (b/w image of design created).\n\n►Can I use my OWN PHOTO OR LOGO? \n★Yes, absolutely!  Your image just needs to be:\n  a.  high quality (300 dpi at product size or vector)\n  b. 100% black and white (black is what gets engraved).\n  c.  not violate any copyright or trademarks.\n  d.  be complete with all text and/or imagery in one file and not need any editing on our part.  \nNOTE: If any changes, modifications, additions or other editing is needed, this service is available at additional cost based on what is needed.\n\nTO ORDER USING YOUR OWN LOGO OR DESIGN:\n❶Go to our Custom Products Page here:  https://www.etsy.com/shop/BootlegBarrels?ref=shopsection_leftnav_8&search_query=logo\n❷ Select the listing with the size you would like (1,2,3,5, 10 or 20 liters) \n❸ Select a Finish Option from the drop down menu (Finished or Unfinished).\n❹ Select a Hoop Color you want (Black, Steel or Brass)\n❺ Read & agree to our copyright policy by selecting &quot;Yes&quot; from drop down menu.\n❻ Email your complete artwork to  art [!at] customsentiments.com being sure to reference your Etsy Order Number in the email.\n\nCOPYRIGHT POLICY: \nWe DO NOT accept artwork that violates any copyright or trademark.

Please contact us if you have any questions regarding this copyright policy. \n✪Custom barrels can take longer, depending on whether the artwork is ready to engrave or needs any editing. \n\nIMAGE FORMATS ACCEPTED:\nSince we are designers as well, we use and are very familiar with most major design programs (Illustrator, Corel Draw, Photoshop, WPC, Flexi Sign, etc.)  We accept almost any image format, (jpg, png, eps, cdr, ai, psd, pdf, fx or wpc).  Etsy does not allow uploading of any vector images, so if you have a vector image, please email it to  art [!at] customsentiments.com, being sure to reference your Etsy order number in the email.  If you are wanting us to create something custom for you, please see below, as there is additional costs for us to create custom artwork.\n\n►DO YOU OFFER CUSTOM DESIGN SERVICES?\n★Yes, we can design almost anything you can imagine!  There is an additional cost for custom designing or editing and the cost will be based on intricacy of the design and how long it will take to create.  Our minimum art fee is $35 for a basic all text design or simple edit and goes up from there based on intricacy and time estimated to complete the project. Simply let us know what you are envisioning and we can give you a quote!  Be as specific as possible in your request, (using visuals if possible) so that we can be sure your receive an accurate quote, timeline and to ensure you will be satisfied with the outcome.  Once you have placed your custom order, you will be referred to Joni, Kirsten or Leici to assist you in the design process.  We include the initial proof, one small revision and one additional proof with each paid art fee. Additional revisions and proofs are at additional cost ($10+ ea), so please be as specific as possible regarding your art request. If you decide to start completely over or your design goes into a different direction or you need a more involved edit, you will need to discuss the cost of the new design and you will be charged a new custom art fee for that new design.\n\n====================================================================\n\n               ✪✪✪✪    BUSINESS HOURS AND HOLIDAY CLOSINGS:   ✪✪✪✪\nWe are open M-F 7am- 4pm EST and are closed on the weekends and Holidays to allow us to observe this time with our families.

We offer larger sizes as well, but they cannot be customized due to their size. \nBARREL DIMENSIONS:\n1 Liter   6.5 x 4.5 x 4.5 inches\n2 Liter   7.5 x 5 x 5 inches\n3 Liter   8.5 x 5.5 x 5.5 inches\n5 Liter   9.5 x 6.5 x 6.5 inches\n10 Liter  12 x 8 x 8 inches\n20 Liter   15 x 10.5 x 10.5 inches\n*DIMESIONS ABOVE DO NOT INCLUDE STAND HEIGHT AND WIDTH. If needing to fit within a specific space, please contact us and we can provide measurements including the stand.\n\n\nQUESTION: What&#39;s the difference between the finish and hoop color options? ANSWER: \nSteel Hoops are made of steel.\nBlack hoops are powder coated steel hoops.\nFinished will have a few light sprays of clear coat on it.\nUnfinished is simply unfinished- no clear coat\n✪No heavy stains, dyes or varnishes are used on these barrels so it will not affect the integrity of the barrel. Finished vs. unfinished is purely an aesthetics preference. Please note that since wood is a natural product it may be lighter or darker than depicted in photos.  Photos are of an actual barrel with designs superimposed onto the barrel. Barrels ate not printed, they are engraved using a laser burner.\n\nQUESTION: How are these made?\nANSWER: These are made using a laser burner, as most custom distillery grade barrels are.  It is completely normal to have darker areas around the engraved portion of your barrel caused by the laser.  This is not smudging and is meant to give your barrel it&#39;s character. Some barrels will have more than others, but that is what makes each barrel unique and no two barrels alike.  Please love and respect your custom barrels for the unique pieces of art they are and they will love you back ;)  \n\nQUESTION: What are the barrels made from?\nANSWER: Our barrels are made from premium quality American White Oak. The staves are air dried for two years and all barrels have a medium char.\n\nQUESTION: How do I cure the barrel?\nANSWER: Barrels should be cured prior to use. Start by filling the barrel with boiling or hot water and leave it to soak for 3 to 5 days. This allows the barrel to swell tightly against the hoops and ensure that the barrel doesn&#39;t leak.  Your barrel WILL leak if you have not cured it.\n\nQUESTION: Are glues or nails used to make the barrel?\nANSWER: No, our barrels are all hand crafted with no use of glues or nails.\n\nQUESTION: How should the barrel be stored?\nANSWER: Barrels are best stored in a cool damp environment such as a wine cellar. This will keep the exterior from drying out and minimize evaporation (Angels Share).  \n\nQUESTION: How many times can I use my barrel?\nANSWER: These are high grade barrels!  With proper care, you can use your barrel for 8 to 10 years. Following the cleaning and re-charing instructions will insure a long life for your product and be sure to not let your barrel dry out.\n\nQUESTION: I left my barrel dry for an extented time. Now it leaks... what do I do?\nANSWER: In many cases just re-cure the barrel. If it continues leaking, submerge the barrel in water for a couple of days. After it&#39;s been submerged, dry the exterior with a towel and fill it with water to see if it continues to leak. If so, find the leak and apply barrel wax to the hole... If you can&#39;t stop the leaking... cut in half and use as a planter!\n\nQUESTION: My barrel is rough around the edges and does not look exactly like pictured.  Is this a defect?  \nANSWER: No, these are made with natural wood and therefore there will always be variation in color, roughness, veining, etc.  This does not affect the functionality of your barrel and is not a defect.  This is something that every barrel company has to deal with and cannot be helped regardless of where you order from.  We just like to be more upfront about it.  In the barrel world, the uniqueness of each barrel is also what we consider it&#39;s character.  Although similar, no two barrels will ever be alike and that is what gives the barrels their character and what lends to the beauty and uniqueness of each barrel.  We suggest loving your barrel for the truly unique piece of art and it will love you back ;)\n\n*********************************************************************************************\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪ CLEANING FAQ&#39;S ✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\n***********************************************************************************************\n\nQUESTION: How often do I clean my barrel?\nANSWER: When aging hard spirits such as whiskey, rum or tequila, clean the barrel after two or three batches (or every 1 to 2 years). For wine, cider, liquor or other low alcohol content spirits, clean after each batch.\n\nQUESTION: How do I clean  my barrel?\nMULTI- STEP ANSWER:\n1.Dissolve the Cleaning Solution into warm water (we sell a cleaning kit for this). Fill the barrel with this cleaning solution and soak for 24 hours. Empty and rinse 3 times with hot water.\n2.Dissolve the Neutralizing Acid into warm water. Fill the barrel with this neutralizing solution and soak for 15 minutes. Empty and rinse the barrel 3 times with hot water.\n3.To re-char the barrel interior, drain the barrel for 3 hours. Place a butane torch in the bung and spigot hole and re-char the inside.\n\nIMPORTANT: To prevent the barrel from drying out and minimize the possibility of contamination, barrels should always be stored full with spirits or water with sterilizing solution.\n\n***See cleaning package directions for exact mixture quantities.\n\n*********************************************************************************************\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪ STORING FAQ&#39;S ✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\n***********************************************************************************************\n\nQUESTION: How do I store my barrel?\nANSWER: When storing the barrel fill the barrel with a mixture of sterilizing tablets and cool water. Fill the barrel with the solution and leave in a cool damp place until you are ready to use again.\n\n*********************************************************************************************\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪ AGING FAQ&#39;S ✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\n***********************************************************************************************\n\nQUESTION: How long do I age my spirits?\nANSWER: There&#39;s no formula for the perfect time to age your spirits. Age to taste! We suggest you taste your spirits every week and once aged to YOUR taste, start drinking or move it to a glass bottle to stop the aging process.  \n\nQUESTION: Do smaller barrels age the spirit faster than large barrels?\nANSWER: Yes... due to the greater surface or contact area ratio, small size barrels will age 5 to 10 times faster then your standard 55 gallon barrel. These means that one month in a small barrel will produce the equivalent aging to 1 to 1 1/2 years in a full size barrel.\n\n*********************************************************************************************\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪ BOOTLEGGIN&#39; ✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\n***********************************************************************************************\n\nQUESTION: How do I get Whiskey from a bottle of Vodka, Swish or Moonshine?\nANSWER: When alcohol is distilled, either from potatoes, corn, fruit, grain or sugar cane, it produces Ethanol. A clear and tasteless alcohol. Distilleries then flavor and filter the alcohol to get their unique flavor. Vodka is the only alcohol you can buy in an unflavored form. When mixed with a bottle of  Barrel Premium Essence, you can recreate the taste of many of the famous brands.\n\nQUESTION: Will a more expensive Vodka produce a better tasting whiskey?\nANSWER: No!  We actually recommend using a cheaper Vodka such as Taaka or the like, as it will pick up the flavors better and thus have a better taste.\n\nQUESTION: Do you sell Bootleg kits?  \nANSWER: Yes, we do!  Simply contact us and we would be happy to assist you.",

An excellent way to express your fondness for a favorite indulgence.

I am not an employee of Etsy, I am a private seller who lists her items on Etsy.   I etch your glasses in my garage and pack them up in my kitchen.  I&#39;m a real person who feels joy out of the fact that my customers are celebrating their weddings and special occasions with the glasses that I designed and engraved by my two hands.  I am also someone who doesn&#39;t want you to have a bad experience ordering from me, so please contact me first with issues with your order and give me a chance to make it right.  I can usually fix the issue fairly quickly and I usually don&#39;t require the item to be returned to me if the fault is my own or with the USPS.  Please see my policies for more information.\r\n  \r\nIf you are happy with your glasses, please consider leaving feedback.  I appreciate your input as it helps future customers with their purchasing decisions and most of all, it makes me happy when my customers are happy!\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\nErin",

"policy_payment": "All credit cards as well as Paypal accepted.  \r\n\r\nI do not offer free items for blogs, Instagram, social media sites, etc.  Any messages asking for free items will be reported to Etsy as spam.  Thank you.",
"policy_shipping": "Please watch your Etsy mailbox during the next few days, as I may need to contact you in order to confirm information regarding your order (ex: dates, spelling of names, address, etc.).  Your order WILL NOT SHIP until this information is confirmed.\r\n\r\nOrders placed will be shipped out 3-7 business (M-F, excluding weekends and holidays) days after being paid for. Custom orders may take longer depending on how elaborate they are, but 99% of the time all of my  orders go out within a week. \r\n\r\nMy domestic shipping prices are priority prices, which I am aware is not the cheapest option.  However, the reasons I ship priority within the U.S. is because:\r\n  \r\n1.  Priority packages are passed around a lot less than parcel select (cheaper shipping) which lessens the chance of the glasses getting broken before they reach you.  Even though I have a free replacement policy for broken glass (please see my policy under &quot;refunds&quot; on this), it&#39;s still a bummer to have to wait for a replacement glass to arrive.  I used to ship parcel select in the past to save my customers on shipping cost but no matter how well I protected the glasses in packing materials, I was having far too many issues with them getting broken in transit.  So, I made the decision to only ship priority mail for anything larger than a shot glass.\r\n\r\n2.  During my busy seasons (wedding season and Christmas), my processing time can stretch out to 7 business days which can equal up to 11 days total when including weekends and holidays.  Once the glasses ship, I&#39;d like my customers to not have to wait much longer after that to receive their items.\r\n\r\n3.  You receive your items faster, so if there are any issues (broken glasses, errors, etc) or you would like to order additional glasses, there will be ample time before your wedding date/holiday/occasion to do any of that.\r\n\r\n(Please note, shot glasses and shot glass sets of 2 still have the option to ship first glass.)\r\n\r\nNote for International Shipping Rates:\r\nI prefer to ship  everything Priority Mail International.\r\nFirst Class International Mail is less expensive, but there is no tracking, and most packages take about a month or longer to arrive. \r\nIf you wish to purchase First Class shipping instead I can do that, but I must warn you once the package ships I have no way of tracking it at all and there is a higher risk of them getting broken in transit.  I replace all broken glasses for free (please see my policy under &quot;refunds&quot; on this) however, its a bummer to have to wait another month or so for the replacement to arrive.\r\n\r\nProcessing time does not include ship time. If you need your order by a specific date please contact me PRIOR to placing your order to make sure that I am able to meet the deadline.  I also offer Express Overnight Processing that can be added to your order by clicking here:\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/205754025/express-processing\r\n\r\nI do not offer Overnight Shipping services.  Please do not select Express Shipping but instead opt for the cheaper alternative of my $9.00 express processing fee which can be purchased here:\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/205754025/express-processing\r\n \r\nUNITED STATES: Shipped Via Priority mail usually takes 2-4 days shipping in the US, but is NOT GUARANTEED. If you need an item by a certain date, please contact me prior to purchase for express mail shipping prices. \r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL ORDERS: Shipped via First Class International Mail, Ship time varies based on your location, but can take up to 4-5 weeks to receive.  International Priority service take 10-14 business days.  Please be aware that there may be custom fees that I am not aware of and it is against the law for me to charge them to you before hand OR pay for them on my end.\r\n\r\n**Projected shipping dates are for shipping date only, NOT a guarantee of delivery. Once item is accepted into USPS system I am no longer liable for date of delivery.  If you would like to check your projected shipping date, please click us the drop down menu under &quot;you&quot; in the top right hand corner and select &quot;purchases and reviews&quot;.  \r\n\r\nIf you need your order to be processed (made) quicker than 5 business, please use the link below to add the &#39;&#39;Express Processing&#39;&#39; to your order:\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/205754025/express-processing?",
"policy_refunds": "Refunds:\r\nAll personalized item (glasses with a name, for example) sales are final.  However, if you are unhappy with your item please communicate with me first before leaving feedback so I can fix or replace your item.  I am a very reasonable person and willing to work with you, but if you leave a bad review, Etsy finalizes it and my hands will be tied.  I&#39;d rather fix it for you than have an upset customer.\r\n\r\nCompletely custom made item sales are final, however, Some items are eligible for return depending on if they can be sold again. Glasses that have a common wedding date, without any personalization like a name, or that are a standard design are eligible for return minus shipping and may be subject to a standard 20% restocking fee.  Buyer pays return shipping.  \r\n\r\nDamaged Items and Free Replacement Guarantee:\r\nI offer a Free Replacement Guarantee to all items that arrive damaged after a picture of the damaged item is received.  Please send a picture of the broken item and a picture of the the shipping box with tracking number shown through the Etsy messaging system, or you may email or text it to the phone number or email address listed on the business card included in your package.  Next you will be sent a link to sign the Recipient Affidavit as required by the company I insure my boxes through.  I guarantee FREE replacement of any broken glasses to be sent out the following business day unless I specify otherwise.  A picture of the broken item MUST BE SENT to me and the Affidavit MUST BE completed before a free replacement glass is sent to you.\r\n\r\nErrors:\r\nIf it&#39;s my mistake, I&#39;ll send out a corrected item right away.  Buyer is responsible for making sure all of the customization is correct before placing the order.  If it&#39;s your mistake, I am willing to make you a replacement at a discounted price.",
"policy_additional": "Cancellation Policy:\r\nOrders can be cancelled up until they are shipped.

If you item is damaged, please send me a picture of the broken glass so I can file a claim with the post office and send out a replacement ASAP.  I am a reasonable persona nd if you simply don&#39;t like your items, I&#39;m sure we can work something out.  However, if you leave a bad review without contacting me, Etsy will finalize our transaction and my hands will be tied.\r\n\r\nCustom Listings:  Once a custom listing is created, the purchase must be complete before any design is created for the buyer.  After purchase, I will design your item and correspond with you throughout the production process.  Pictures of the design will be sent through the Etsy messaging system until it is perfected for you.  If we can&#39;t decide on a design, your order can be cancelled for a full refund.  The policy is in place because of a design that was stolen from me before the purchase was complete, so I can no longer offer designs before purchase.

You can also choose the color of the box from the drop down menu at check out.  You can add names to the box also.\n\n**What are Whiskey Stones?**\n\nWhiskey Stones, are a new way to chill your whiskey or wine without diluting your drink. Ice cubes water down your whiskey and leave a moist layer of condensation on your glass, whiskey stones have all the benefits of ice without the hassles.\n\nWhiskey Stones are made out of cubes of solid soapstone which is softer than granite and won’t scratch your glass. Soapstone retains its temperature much longer than ice, so it will cool your whiskey or liquor of your choice and provide a more sustained chill. Whiskey Stones are also non-porous, odorless and tasteless so they won’t alter your favorite drinks. Whiskey Stones can also be used to warm your drinks and work well with non-alcoholic beverages too.\n\nStill thinking and in need of more ideas?

I add new items weekly so please Favorite my shop so you are the first to see the new arrivals.\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/TheUltimateManShop",
