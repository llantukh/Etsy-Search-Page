For this assignment we had to recreate a mockup of an etsy search page. We have done something similar to this in the past; the main difference is that this time we have to use JavaScript to get the search results onto the page instead of HTML.

The JavaScript part of this project was bit of a challenge for me. I finally figured out how to pull nested data, which is super exciting. However, getting it onto my page was incredibly frustrating. I understand how to do it now, but getting there made me want to cry a little...and by cry a little I mean I wanted to throw my computer out the window. But I'm good now :D

I am not finished with this project yet, I have some CSS to tweak, but I have to get started on another assignment for now. I will come back and finish making this look pretty this weekend.
